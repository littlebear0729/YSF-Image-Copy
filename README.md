# YSF-Image-Copy

This project comprises a Python script, the purpose of which is to facilitate the copying of picture image files onto &mu;SD cards used by certain amateur radio VHF/UHF transceivers. The image file will be re-formatted for compatibility and associated metadata files created/updated. The end result will be that image files are usable on the rig, allowing transmission over the air.
